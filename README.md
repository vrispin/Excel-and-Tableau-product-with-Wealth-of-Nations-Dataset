# Wealth of Nations Dataset Analysis

## Overview
This repository contains a project focused on analyzing the Wealth of Nations dataset. The dataset has been processed and visualized using both Excel and Tableau to extract insights into various socio-economic indicators.

## Excel Analysis
In the Excel portion of the project, I cleaned, filtered, and sorted the Wealth of Nations dataset to prepare it for analysis. Additionally, I created several charts to visualize key relationships and trends within the data. Moreover, I implemented measures to protect the Excel file, ensuring data integrity and security.

## Tableau Dashboard
Following the Excel analysis, I imported the cleaned dataset into Tableau to create an interactive dashboard. The dashboard consists of four visualizations that highlight important correlations and patterns within the data.

### Visualizations
1. GDP vs. Smartphone Users: This visualization explores the relationship between a country's GDP and the number of smartphone users, providing insights into economic development and technology adoption.
2. Life Expectancy at Birth: This visualization illustrates the life expectancy at birth across different nations, shedding light on healthcare and quality of life indicators.
3. Smartphone Users Distribution: This visualization presents the distribution of smartphone users across countries, offering insights into global technology penetration.
4. [Fourth Visualization]: Describe the fourth visualization here.

## Usage
To explore the analysis and visualizations:
- Download the Excel file to delve into the detailed analysis and charts.
- View the Tableau dashboard online or download the Tableau file to interact with the visualizations.

## Future Enhancements
In the future, I plan to expand this analysis by incorporating additional datasets or refining the existing visualizations to provide more comprehensive insights into global socio-economic trends.
